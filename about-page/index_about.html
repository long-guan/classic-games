                <h1>Lazy Knight</h1>
                <div>
                    <h3>Description</h3>
                    <div>App that calculates and animates the least number of moves needed for a knight to move from the chosen start location to the end location on a chess board.</div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Features</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Tree where each node has 8 child nodes to represent the 8 possible moves that a knight can take on a board</li>
                        <li>Breadth First Search Traversal of a tree to find the least number of moves needed to move from start location to end location</li>
                        <li>Animation of the knight moving on the board by using vanilla JS (combination of setTimeout, transform, and updating the location of the knight on the board with each transform)</li>
                        <li>Separation of logic and user interface</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Built With</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>HTML5</li>
                        <li>CSS3</li>
                        <li>Vanilla JS</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Difficulties Encountered</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Problem: When traversing the tree to find the end location, I needed a way to save all the nodes that were traversed to reach the end location.</li>
                        <li>Solution: Instead of adding only the next node into the queue for BFS, add all the previously traversed nodes with the next node as the last index in an array before adding it in the queue. Then return the entire array of nodes when the last index of the array of nodes matches the end location.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Future Improvements</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Add feature to change the size of the board</li>
                        <li>Use recursion instead of for loops to refactor the algorithm for constructing the tree</li>
                        <li>Revise traverse algorithm to be more efficient by only traversing the nodes that will result in being closer to the end location. It is currently traversing all the possible moves.</li>
                        <li>Add a sister game that asks the player to input the least number of moves needed to move from start to end with the given start and end location</li>
                    </ul>
